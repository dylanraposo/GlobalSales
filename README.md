# Global Sales Analysis

In this project we obtained a global transportation sales database off of kaggle.com. Due to this dataset being fairly structured, we just did some basic cleaning in excel to make our querying easier. After this we did some basic EDA and a few complex queries in order to pull as much insight and information necessary from our database. After answering various questions, we took the data to Tableau to visualize some of these key metrics. 
SQL queries can be found in file: "salesQueries.sql"
